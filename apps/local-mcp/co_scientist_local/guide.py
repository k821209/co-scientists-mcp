"""Canonical agent-facing guide for the co-scientist MCP.

Returned by the `project_guide()` MCP tool. Update HERE (not in the
dashboard's CLAUDE.md template) so changes flow to all users on
`pip install --upgrade co-scientist-local` — even those whose CLAUDE.md
on disk was downloaded months ago.

CLAUDE.md on the user's project directory stays tiny (project identity
only) and refers the agent here on every session start.

## How this project works

A human collaborator views the dashboard and can leave inline comments on
specific passages by drag-selecting in the manuscript. Each comment lands
in Firestore as a `review` with `source='user'`, `status='open'`, plus an
`anchor_text` field containing the exact selected passage and a
`manuscript_ref` like `section:<key>`. The dashboard renders the anchor
as a yellow highlight in the rendered manuscript; clicking the highlight
opens a popover with the comment.

On every session start:

1. Call `mcp__co_scientist__whoami()` once — verifies the MCP is bound to
   the project_id your CLAUDE.md mentions. If they differ, STOP and tell
   the user — they likely mixed `.mcp.json` and `CLAUDE.md` from two
   different dashboard projects. (The MCP also prints a stderr warning
   banner on startup when this mismatch is detected.)
2. Call `mcp__co_scientist__list_papers()` then, for each paper,
   `mcp__co_scientist__count_open_user_comments(slug)`. If non-zero,
   call `mcp__co_scientist__list_reviews(slug, status="open")` to get
   the open comments with their `anchor_text` — use that quoted passage
   to locate the exact place in the manuscript the user is pointing at,
   then offer `/paper-revision`.

## Available skills

- `/paper-writing [title]` — create or update manuscript sections
- `/paper-revision` — address open user comments (anchor_text-anchored)
- `/paper-export [docx|tex|pdf|md]` — pandoc-based export with placeholder/
  unresolved-DOI pre-flight check; uploads result to Storage so the
  dashboard's Paper page lists it.
- `/literature-review [topic] [slug?]` — CrossRef keyword search via
  `search_works`, candidate-then-pick UX, registers selected via
  `add_reference_by_doi`, writes a structured synthesis.
- `/paper-review [slug] [mode?]` — three-persona AI review (methods /
  stats / domain) + consistency pass; each finding becomes one
  Firestore review row (`source="ai"`) anchored to the offending
  passage so the dashboard renders inline highlights.
- `/analysis-run [name]` — wrap a computation (local or registered HPC)
  in a tracked run, then `add_figure` / `add_table` selected outputs.
  Dashboard Runs tab streams logs in real time.
- `/scientific-image` — staged pipeline (classify → blueprint →
  generate → critique) around `generate_image` for schematics
  (pathway, network, workflow, comparison, architecture, tree).
  Real data plots go through `/analysis-run` instead.

## Citation format + hallucination check

Inline DOI: `{{doi:10.1234/example}}`. References auto-managed via
`mcp__co_scientist__add_reference_by_doi(slug, doi)` — fetches title,
authors, journal, year from CrossRef so you never invent them. Refuses
DOIs CrossRef can't find (404 → almost always a hallucinated citation).

Two-axis verification model — and the MCP only owns one of them:

  - **DOI axis** (server-decidable): does CrossRef know this DOI?
    Browser Sync button and `validate_references` both write this.
    Deterministic — no LLM needed.
  - **Context axis** (YOU decide, not the server): does the cited
    paper's content actually fit the manuscript's claim around its
    `{{doi:X}}` marker? Word-overlap is too weak a proxy; only you
    have the manuscript intent loaded.

Workflow YOU follow per session:

1. Call `mcp__co_scientist__validate_references(slug)`. It returns a
   facts pack:
     - `unresolved[]` — CrossRef 404s. Almost always fake DOIs.
     - `missing_doi[]` — references with no DOI to check.
     - `results[]` — one entry per resolved DOI with:
         * `crossref`: title, abstract, subjects, authors, year, journal
         * `manuscript_contexts`: every `{{doi:X}}` occurrence with
           full sentence + ±240 char context + `stacked_with` peers
         * `signals`: raw overlap counts (HINTS, not verdicts)
2. For each `results[]` entry, READ the crossref abstract/title and
   compare against `manuscript_contexts`. Decide if the citation fits.
3. Record your decision:
     `acknowledge_finding(slug, doi, verdict="approved"|"rejected",
        note="<why>")`
   - approved → context_verified=true → dashboard ribbon turns green
   - rejected → context_verified=false → fix the citation (delete or
     replace via `add_reference_by_doi`) before next session

For unresolved DOIs, just delete the reference (or replace via
`add_reference_by_doi(slug, real_doi)`) and `acknowledge_finding(slug,
doi, note="hallucinated, removed")`.

The dashboard shows two ribbons per reference (`✓ DOI` / `✓ Context`).
`?` Context means you haven't judged it yet. Both green = trusted.

**On every session start, also call**
`mcp__co_scientist__list_verification_findings(slug)` for each paper.
Returns unacknowledged problem findings (unresolved hallucinations,
title mismatches, errors). If non-empty:
  1. Surface them to the user.
  2. Fix each (delete bad ref / replace with real citation / re-fetch
     via `add_reference_by_doi`).
  3. Call `acknowledge_finding(slug, doi, note="...")` once handled
     so it stops surfacing.

For single-citation spot checks: `verify_doi(doi)` returns metadata
without writing anything.

## Math mode (Pandoc)

Use `$...$` (inline) or `$$...$$` (display) for variables with
sub/superscripts, Greek letters as variables, fractions, sums. Leave
`n = 69` / `q < 0.005` / `α-helix` as plain text. `prepare_export` returns
`math_warnings` flagging violations.

## Remote job rule

**Never** launch a long-running remote job via raw `ssh <alias> "nohup ..."`.
Use `mcp__co_scientist__submit_remote_job` so the run is tracked in
`analysis_runs` and visible in the dashboard.

## Image generation

`mcp__co_scientist__generate_image` routes through a Firebase Cloud Function
(Pro+ subscription required for the hosted OpenAI gpt-image-2 backend).
Free-tier users with their own `GEMINI_API_KEY` can still generate images
locally via the Gemini backend (imagen-3).
