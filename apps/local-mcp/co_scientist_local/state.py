"""Per-session state: the active project + the backend it writes to.

The local MCP is scoped to **one project** at a time. The project_id is set
at process start from the downloaded MCP bundle (which carries the project's
API key) and never changes during the session. Every tool call uses the
same project_id.

`owner_uid` is kept on State as the project's owning user — useful for owner-
check operations and for the Cloud Function key-exchange flow that mints a
custom token carrying `{ uid, project_id }`. Tools should NOT use uid for
path construction — that's what project_path() is for.
