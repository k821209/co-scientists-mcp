# Setup — user

For someone signing up at `https://co-scientist-5af1a.web.app` and writing
their first paper. Three commands on their machine, the rest in the browser.

## 1. Install the MCP (one-time, ~30s)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k821209/co-scientists-mcp.git ~/co-scientists-mcp
pip install -e ~/co-scientists-mcp/apps/local-mcp
```

Pip-only alternative (no source on disk):

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/k821209/co-scientists-mcp.git#subdirectory=apps/local-mcp"
```

## 2. In the dashboard

1. Sign in (Google or email).
2. Create a project. Free tier = 3 projects.
3. Open the project → **Setup** tab.
4. Click **Download setup script** — gets `setup-<slug>.sh`.

The script bundles `.mcp.json` (with the project's API key) + `CLAUDE.md`
(slim, ~18 lines, refers to `project_guide()` MCP tool for the current
usage instructions). The key is project-scoped; every Firestore write
the MCP makes is constrained to that project by security rules.

## 3. In your project directory

```bash
cd /path/to/your/paper-project
bash ~/Downloads/setup-<slug>.sh
claude          # launch Claude Code
```

Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` + spawns the MCP child process via
`.mcp.json`. The MCP exchanges your API key, signs in to Firebase as the
project owner, and is ready.

Try:

```
/paper-writing "Your paper title"
```

The dashboard's Papers tab updates live as the agent writes sections.

## Sanity checks

- `/mcp` in Claude Code → should show `co_scientist · ✔ connected`.
- Have the agent run `mcp__co_scientist__whoami()` — confirms the MCP
  is bound to the correct project_id (matches what your CLAUDE.md says).
- The MCP startup line on stderr looks like:
  `co-scientist-local: token-auth, project=<pid>, owner=<uid>`.

## Common gotchas

- **Mixing `.mcp.json` + `CLAUDE.md` from different projects** — the MCP
  authenticates to whichever project the API key belongs to, but the
  agent reads project identity from `CLAUDE.md`. They must match.
  `whoami()` catches this.
- **`pip install -e` ed — need to update?** — `git pull` updates the
  source files in-place because the install was editable. But the
  *running MCP child process* imported the code at startup, so you
  need to fully restart Claude Code (cmd-Q on macOS) to spawn a new
  child with the new code.
- **OPENAI_API_KEY in your shell** — only used if you also set
  `CO_SCIENTIST_USE_LOCAL_OPENAI=1`. Otherwise ignored. See
  [003-pro-only-image-gen](decisions/003-pro-only-image-gen.md).

## Image generation requires Pro

`generate_image` routes through a Firebase Cloud Function. Free plan = 403.
Upgrade in the dashboard (admin manually sets `plan_id=pro` until Stripe
webhook is wired). Free-tier alternative: set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in env +
configure `image_gen_mode=local` in `~/.co-scientist/projects/<pid>.toml`.

See [plans.md](plans.md) for quotas.
