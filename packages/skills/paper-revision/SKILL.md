# /paper-revision

This is the back half of the bidirectional review loop. The dashboard lets
the user leave comments on paragraphs, figures, or specific claims. Those
comments land in Firestore as `reviews` rows with `source='user'`. This
skill walks through them one by one.

## Flow

1. `mcp__co_scientist__list_reviews(slug, status='open', source='user')`
   to fetch every open user comment, newest first.
2. For each comment, show the user:
   - The section / figure / claim it refers to (from `manuscript_ref` and
     `anchor_text`)
   - The comment text
   - The severity
3. Discuss what to do with each:
   - **Accept** — make the requested change in the manuscript.
   - **Reject** — explain why and respond.
   - **Need more info** — pause that one and come back later.
4. For accepted comments, edit the relevant section via
   `mcp__co_scientist__update_section(slug, key, body=...)`.
5. Mark the comment resolved:
   `mcp__co_scientist__update_review(slug, review_id, status='accepted', response='...')`
   The response field is what the human will see in the dashboard alongside
   the "✓ Addressed" badge.

## Anchor Drift

If the comment's `manuscript_ref` points to a paragraph that no longer
exists (you or someone else rewrote it), the `anchor_text` and
`manuscript_snapshot` fields tell you what the user was reacting to.

If you can't find the corresponding location in the current manuscript:
- Surface this clearly to the user
- Ask whether to discard the comment as stale, or to find an analogous
  passage to update

## AI vs External vs User

`list_reviews` can also surface `source='ai'` (from `/paper-review`) and
`source='external'` (imported journal reviewers). The /paper-revision skill
defaults to `source='user'` because those are the live comments waiting on
you; if the user asks "address the reviewer feedback for resubmission" the
filter should be `source='external'`.

## After Addressing All Open Comments

Call `mcp__co_scientist__count_open_user_comments(slug)` to confirm the
count is zero. Report the resolution summary back to the user.
