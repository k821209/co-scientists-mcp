# /paper-writing

**Triggers:** "write the introduction," "draft methods," "create a new paper on X," "expand section Y."

## Flow

### Starting a new paper

1. Ask the user for title + target journal if not provided.
2. Call `mcp__co_scientist__create_paper(title=..., journal=...)`.
3. The canonical 6 sections (abstract, introduction, methods, results,
   discussion, conclusion) are seeded automatically.
4. Suggest next steps: literature review, methods draft, etc.

### Working on an existing paper

1. Call `mcp__co_scientist__list_papers()` if the slug isn't provided.
2. Call `mcp__co_scientist__get_paper_state(slug)` to see the current
   state of all sections and the assembled manuscript.
3. For each section the user wants to write:
   - Ask any clarifying questions (target audience, key claims).
   - Draft the section content.
   - Call `mcp__co_scientist__update_section(slug, key, body=..., status='draft')`.
4. After updating sections, call `mcp__co_scientist__get_paper_state(slug)`
   again and show the user a summary of what changed.

## Citation Format

Inline DOIs: `{doi:10.1234/example}`. You can pre-add references via
`mcp__co_scientist__add_reference(slug, citation_key=..., doi=..., title=..., authors=[...])`
either before or after the prose — `prepare_export` will check for
unresolved citations at export time.

## Status Transitions

Update section status as the work progresses:
- `pending` — placeholder, nothing written
- `in_progress` — actively drafting
- `draft` — first complete draft
- `complete` — content frozen, ready for review

Don't skip stages — the dashboard surfaces `in_progress` to the human so
they know what you're actively editing.

## After Writing

Suggest the human pull up the dashboard at the project's Firebase URL to
read what you wrote and leave inline comments. The comments come back to
you next session via `count_open_user_comments` in the SessionStart banner.
